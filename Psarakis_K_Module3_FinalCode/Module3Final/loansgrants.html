                            <p class="mb-0">A student loan is a type of loan designed to help students pays for post-secondary education and the associated fees, such as tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses.</p> <br>
                            
                            <p class="mb-0"><strong>What is a Grant?</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-0">A student grant is a need-based form of financial aid given to students to help pay for their expenses. Grants are similar to scholarships, because this is money that does not have to be paid back, unlike a student loan.</p> <br>
                                <p class="mb-0"><strong>What is a Scholarship?</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-0">A scholarship is an award of financial aid for a student to further their education at post-secondary or other academic institutions.</p> <br>
                            
                            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Why do I need to apply for these?</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-0">The importance of applying to a loan is based on the students desire to attend school and pay funds without having to pay them back immediately. Grants and Scholarships are similar to having money you owe revoked based on you being illegible and applying for these services.</p> <br>

                            <p>Canada Student Loans, Grants and Scholarships are open to all Canadians. For Ontario student loans you must be a Canadian citizen and Ontario resident for at least 12 months: you could be eligible for OSAP (the Ontario Student Assistance Program) and other financial aid programs. Canadian students living outside of Ontario: you can apply for financial aid through your home province or territory. International students: you can apply for scholarships offered through the federal government, community agencies and colleges and universities directly.</p>
